# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under Data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
  - [Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/trickster-00/Data-science-portfolio/blob/4d7ec07f1b5c4d31164b9067a99a52c50cc8989f/%20finding%20donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
  - [Employee's Exit Prediction](https://github.com/trickster-00/Data-science-portfolio/blob/4d7ec07f1b5c4d31164b9067a99a52c50cc8989f/Employee%20Exit.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various employee's data to make prediction on potential exiters using various ML algorithms.

  Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

- ### Natural Language Processing
  - [How Swiggy Chatbot Works](https://github.com/trickster-00/Data-science-portfolio/blob/4d7ec07f1b5c4d31164b9067a99a52c50cc8989f/NLP%20projects/Chatbot.ipynb) - Building a similar Chatbot system to Swiggy's using NLP and NLTK.

  Tools: scikit-learn,NLTK

- ### ML MIcro Projects
  - [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/trickster-00/Data-science-portfolio/blob/4d7ec07f1b5c4d31164b9067a99a52c50cc8989f/Micro%20projects/Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
  - [ML with KMeans](https://github.com/trickster-00/Data-science-portfolio/blob/4d7ec07f1b5c4d31164b9067a99a52c50cc8989f/Micro%20projects/KMeans%20Classifier%20Project.ipynb): In this project, we analyze the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in a particular region in Italy. And the goal is to try to group similar observations together and determine the number of possible clusters.
  - [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems](https://github.com/trickster-00/Data-science-portfolio/blob/2e7d179dc0068a7ccf425327c5af106b375af282/Micro%20projects/Recommender%20Systems.ipynb): A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.
 
   Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
